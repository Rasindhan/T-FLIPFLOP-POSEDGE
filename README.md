# T-FLIPFLOP-POSEDGE

**AIM:**

**SOFTWARE REQUIRED:**

Quartus prime

**THEORY**

**T Flip-Flop**

T flip-flop is the simplified version of JK flip-flop. It is obtained by connecting the same input ‘T’ to both inputs of JK flip-flop. It operates with only positive clock transitions or negative clock transitions. The circuit diagram of T flip-flop is shown in the following figure.

This circuit has single input T and two outputs Qtt & Qtt’. The operation of T flip-flop is same as that of JK flip-flop. Here, we considered the inputs of JK flip-flop as J = T and K = T in order to utilize the modified JK flip-flop for 2 combinations of inputs. So, we eliminated the other two combinations of J & K, for which those two values are complement to each other in T flip-flop. The following table shows the state table of T flip-flop.

Here, Qtt & Qt+1t+1 are present state & next state respectively. So, T flip-flop can be used for one of these two functions such as Hold, & Complement of present state based on the input conditions, when positive transition of clock signal is applied. The following table shows the characteristic table of T flip-flop. Inputs Present State Next State

From the above characteristic table, we can directly write the next state equation as Q(t+1)=T′Q(t)+TQ(t)′ ⇒Q(t+1)=T⊕Q(t)

**Procedure**

1.Understand the T flip-flop truth table: T=0 → No change, T=1 → Toggle.

2.Write Verilog code using always block triggered on clock edge.

3.Create a testbench to apply clock and T input combinations.

4.Simulate the design using a Verilog simulator (e.g., ModelSim or iverilog).

5.Compare output Q with expected values from the truth table to validate

  always @(posedge clk or posedge rst)

    if (rst)
      q <= 0; // Reset the flip-flop
    else if (t==0)
      q <= q;
